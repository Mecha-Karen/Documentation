Errors
======
Errors are something which plague many of the applications we know today, so we have built stronger error handlers.
These can include catching errors and returning the necessary output to guide you to use the correct command properly.
Or they automatically report the error caused in detail so it can be debugged easily!

Bot
---

If you happen to encounter an error whilst running a command, Karen will prompt you with a message like so:

.. figure:: /images/error.png
   :width: 400px
   :align: center
   :alt: Example of an Error Code

You can either open an issue on our github repo, or contact an executive with your error code!
