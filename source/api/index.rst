API
===

Our API is the backbone for many of our great creations including our dashboard, database and discord bot.
Inorder to access our API you will need an ``Access Token``.

How do I get a Access Token?
----------------------------
Firstly, you need to sign up to our API. If you have already, you can simply login.

Once you have logged in, you will see a screen like:

.. figure:: images/preview.png
    :width: 400px
    :align: center
    :alt: Dashboard Preview

Click the ``Create Token`` button and it will create you a new token! You can modify your token by clicking:

.. figure:: images/edit.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Edit Token

Same way for deleting a token, you can simply press the red icon.

And thats it you have created your very own token, which you can use for accessing our api!
